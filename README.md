A Decision Tree is a simple yet powerful machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It splits data based on conditions, forming a tree-like structure to make predictions.

✅ Easy to interpret
✅ Works with both categorical & numerical data
✅ Fast predictions

However, it can overfit if the tree is too deep. Using pruning and setting a maximum depth can help improve performance.
